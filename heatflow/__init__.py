HeatFlow
========

HeatFlow is a python framework to work with neural networks, tensor, etc. It also provides some useful functions for machine learning and deep learning. HeatFlow gives you full control on your code. It is written on top of numpy which makes it blazing fast compared to other. It uses jit to make the code run as fast as possible.
